# Pull Requests

* Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. main, and merge back against that branch.
* If adding a new feature:
  * Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.
* If fixing bug:
  * Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
* Commit messages should follow the [Commit Message Convention](./commit-message-convention.md) so that changelog can be automatically generated.
